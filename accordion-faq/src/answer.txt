1. How would you improve this?

   -  Accessibility (a11y)
        Add aria-expanded, aria-controls, role="region" for screen readers.
        Support keyboard navigation (ArrowDown, ArrowUp).
    - Performance
        Memoize heavy content with React.memo if FAQ answers are large.
        Virtualize if FAQ has hundreds of items.
    - Animation
        Add Framer Motion or CSS transitions for smooth expand/collapse.
    - Reusability
        Turn it into a generic <Accordion> component.
        Make it controlled (parent manages open state) and uncontrolled (internal state) with props.
    - Dynamic Data
        Load FAQ items from API → show loading skeletons.

2. Can only one item be open at a time?

    "Yes, that’s why I designed it with allowMultiple. If false, it ensures a single open state.”

3. How would you test it?

    “I’d write unit tests with React Testing Library checking expand/collapse, keyboard accessibility, and aria attributes.”

4. How would you handle deep nested accordions?

    “I’d make Accordion recursive — an AccordionItem can accept children that are also Accordions.”
