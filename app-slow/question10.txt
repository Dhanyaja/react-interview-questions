1. How does suspense work, and what are some real use cases beyond lazy loading?

suspense is like a pause button for components. it suspends part of UI until something s ready.

use cases: 
    1. lazy loading components
    2. wait for data(react query, relay)
    3. to avoid layout shift

2. what is useImperativeHandle and when should you use it?

used when a parent component wants to access something from the child component


3. How do you optimize large lists in react?

virtualization - only renders the items that are visible in the viewport 


4. How does useRef differ from useState?

useRef - value should change, but should not cause a re-render (mutable variables without re-render)
useState - re-renders when value changes

5. How does react handle hydration in SSR, and what problems can arise?

hydration is the process react attaches event listeners and internal logic to server rendered HTML

Problems:
    - server-client HTML mismatch
    - using window, math.random() during render
    - different render outputs

Fixes:
    - avoid side effects in render
    - use useEffect for browser only logic
    - ensure consistent outputs
