How do you optimize bundle size in large react app?

1. code splitting - using react.lazy
2. Tree Shaking - in vite/webpack
    it removes unused imports
3. dynamic imports - importing during run time
4. compress assets - compress images, fonts 
5. caching - if it is present on users device, dont ship it
