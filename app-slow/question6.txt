What is react fiber and how does it differ from the old reconciliation algorithm?

Old react(stack based renderer)
uses stack based rendering engine
It couldn't pause once rendering started
UI updated had to finish all at once
It update takes time- the app will be frozen


React fiber:
Interruptible
Breaks rendering into small chunks
Priority based updates
concurrent rendering
supports suspense and lazy loading

Benefits of fiber nodes: Fiber node is a js object that represents a component and its info (type, props, state, link to its parent/child/sibling)
Fiber tree: A tree of fiber nodes (a map of component tree)


Why is it better:
Enables concurrent and interruptible rendering
makes react smooth and responsive
