How does react determine when to re-render a component?

React re-renders a component when its state or props change.
React re-renders when state, props, or context change, then uses the Virtual DOM diffing (Fiber) to update only whatâ€™s necessary in the real DOM.


Optimizations:
- use React.memo() to avoid unnecessary renders
- useMemo and useCallback to cache values/functions
- avoid inline objects/arrays in jsx
