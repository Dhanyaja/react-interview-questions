What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback, and when not to use them?

useMemo - caches the result of the function
useCallback - caches the function itself

when sending any data from parent to child, memoize the child using useMemo or useCallback to prevent it from re-rendering unnecessarily.


useMemo - for heavy calculations
useCallback - stable function

use them only when necessary as they also occupy some memory.
