Q1. How would you make this component reusable across the app?

    Extract Star into its own file, allow size, color, and defaultValue as props. Pass onChange callback to integrate with forms.

Q2. How do you handle half-stars (like 3.5)?
    
    Track rating as a float (e.g., 3.5), add mouse position detection inside each star to decide whether to fill half or full. Can use two overlapping spans (one gold, one gray) with a clip-path for partial fill.

Q3. How would you test this component?
    
    Use React Testing Library:
    Simulate clicks → check if correct number of stars are filled.
    Simulate hover → check preview.
    Accessibility: check if screen readers detect stars (aria-label).

Q4. How to persist rating (e.g., save to backend)?
    
    Pass an onChange prop, which makes an API call to save rating. Use optimistic updates for smooth UX.
