1. How would you pause auto-rotation when the user hovers over the card?

    Add onMouseEnter={() => setPaused(true)} / onMouseLeave={() => setPaused(false)} and conditionally skip starting the interval.

2. How would you animate transitions between testimonials?

    Use framer-motion or CSS transitions:
    opacity: 0 → 1 fade effect.
    Slide effect with transform: translateX.

3. How would you optimize if there are heavy images/videos in testimonials?

    Lazy-load offscreen testimonials with loading="lazy" for images, or only render the active card ({testimonials[current]} instead of all cards).

4. How would you make this controlled from the parent?

    Accept current and onChange props. If given, rely on them instead of internal state.

5. How would you test it?

    With React Testing Library:
    Assert the first testimonial is visible.
    Simulate click on "Next" → assert the next testimonial appears.
    Advance timers (jest.useFakeTimers()) → check auto-rotation works.
